I am a web designer and front-end software engineer with a background in the analytical fields of business and economics. I love to design and write code guided by my personal design philosophy of remaining simple, yet ever-evolving. My area of focus is front-end software development, including UI and UX and continuously expanding my knowledge base. I work well on interdisciplinary UX, engineering, and product teams.
